### CPSC 120
* Lab 3

     In Lab 3, we calculated and coded the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) of men
     and women. Using Mifflin-St Jeor's equation; we created a program to
     calculate the user's BMR. I enjoyed this lab assingment because we created
     and called multiple functions that worked together to find the BMR. In 
     part 2, we did something similar by calculating the difference between 
     two dates. I enjoyed writing the formula and comparing the 2 dates.

* Lab 7

     In Lab 7, we created a program that calculated the dates on parking signs
     and would tell the user if they could park on that street. My favorite 
     part of this lab was writing the if-statements and the parameters of the
     function. 
    
* Lab 10

    In Lab 10, we created a 2D vector to store and contain the names and
    populations for counties in the state of California. My favorite part
    of this lab was creating the loop functions. These loop functions would
    go through each name and population value and store them in the 2D vector.
